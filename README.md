# SGP30

Arduino library for SGP30 environment sensor

Warning: experimental, 0.1.0 is functional not complete.

## Description

The SGP30 from Sensirion is an environment sensor that measures H2 and Ethanol in the air. From these numbers an intern algorithm derives an CO2 equivalent and a TVOC measurement. 

The CO2 units are ppm, the TVOC units are ppb. Units for H2 and Ethanol are unknown. For larger concentrations the resolution drops, see datasheet.

The CO2 and TVOC values can be read up to once per second (1 Hz). Ethanol and H2, the raw data can be sampled up to 40 Hz.

The library supports 2 types of interfaces, a synchronous and an asynchronous interface. The sync interface is blocking for up to 40 milliseconds which was enough to trigger the implementation of an async interface. Note: the sync interface is implemented with the async interface.

The SGP30 works with I2C bus at 100 KHz and 400 KHz. In a short test it worked well up to 600 KHz. A faster I2C clock does not give the sync interface much (relative) gain, however for the async the relative gain is much more.

It may take up to 10 seconds (maybe more) before the sensor produces real data.


#### multi sensors.

The sensor has a fixed I2C address so only one sensor per I2C bus can be used. If one needs more, one should use an I2C multiplexer or an MCU with multiple I2C buses or switch the VCC as a sort of ChipSelect signal.


## Interface

### Constructor

- **SGP30(TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** Constructor with optional the Wire interface as parameter.
- **bool begin()** .
- **bool begin(sda, scl)** idem, for the ESP32 where one can choose the I2C pins.
- **bool isConnected()** checks if the address is visable on the I2C bus.


### Meta

- **bool getID()** reads the sensor ID into 12 bytes. (needs rework).
- **uint16_t getFeatureSet()** returns 0x0022, indicates that commands used in this library are supported.
- **bool measureTest()** verify the chip is working.


### Synchronous measurements

- **uint32_t lastMeasurement()** timestamp in millis of the last sync measurement made. This convenience function is useful to prevent reading the sensor too often.
- **bool measure(bool all = false)** if all == false, only the TVOC and CO2 are updated (slow due to blocking), if all == true, also the H2 and the Ethanol values are updated (even slower). Note the measurement is slow as there is an active blocking until the sensor is done. If the last measurement is less than a second ago, no measurement is made and the function returns false.


### A-synchronous measurements

With the async interface, the user should control that reads are at least one second apart. The user should also take care not to mix up different requests. See examples. 

- **void request()** sends a request to the sensor to read CO2 and TVOC. 
- **bool read()** returns true if the last request is more than 12 millis ago the CO2 and TVOC are read and updated. Otherwise false is returned.
- **void requestRaw()** sends a request to the sensor to read H2 and Ethanol.
- **bool readRaw()** returns true if the last request is more than 25 millis ago the H2 and Ethanol are read and updated. Otherwise false is returned.


### Get the data

The library caches the last read values, and these are the functions to access them. 

- **uint16_t getTVOC()** gets the TVOC concentration (ppb)
- **uint16_t getCO2()** gets the CO2 **equivalent** concentration (ppm)
- **uint16_t getH2()** gets the H2 concentration. Units unknown.
- **uint16_t getEthanol()** gets the Ethanol concentration. Units unknown.


### Calibration

Check the datasheet for operating range, figure 7.

- **float setRelHumidity(float T, float RH)** sets the compensation for temperature (5-55Â°C) and **relative** humidity (10-95%). These values can be obtained e.g. from an SHT30, DHT22 or similar sensor.
- **void setAbsHumidity(float AbsoluteHumidity)** sets the compensation for **absolute** humidity. Concentration is in gram per cubic meter (g/m3)


### Baseline functions

The baseline functions give the sensor a reference value. After running in a known condition e.g. outside in open air, one can get the baseline values as a sort of calibration. Please read the datasheet carefully before using these functions.

Note: if the sensor has no reads done, these values tend to go to zero. This is because the baselines are based upon recent reads.

- **bool getBaseline(uint16_t *CO2, uint16_t *TVOC)**
- **void setBaseline(uint16_t CO2, uint16_t TVOC)** 


### Misc

- **int lastError()** returns last error. (needs rework)


## Todo

- redo **getID()**
- redo **lastError()**
- should **getFeatureSet()** become **bool checkFeatureSet()**?
- implement the TVOC starter baseline.
- test test test ....
- get units H2 right if possible
- get units Ethanol right if possible
- CRC handling
- error handling
